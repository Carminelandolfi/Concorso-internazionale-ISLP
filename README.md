Winners at national level.

This project concerns a competition organized by ISTAT, which aims to promote the results of the 7th Census of Agriculture and related topics, in collaboration with the Council for Agricultural Research and Agricultural Economics Analysis - Centre for Policy and Bioeconomy (Crea-PB). Crea-PB provides farm data of a technical-economic nature, collected through the annual RICA survey (Farm Accountancy Data Network).

In this poster, our group focused on the growing impact of renewable energy on our lives. Specifically, we performed an unsupervised learning analysis using the K-means clustering method to group similar regions based on their use of renewable energy. We then compared these findings with data from the 6th Census of Agriculture to observe how renewable energy production has changed over time. Finally, we provided recommendations for further improving the use of renewable energy.
